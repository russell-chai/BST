This project is a database representing a folder of media.
Different types of media include games, music, and movies.
Source code of each type of media, including the base class
for all media, can be found in the respective cpp and header
files: Media.cpp/Media.h, Game.cpp/Game.h, Music.cpp/Music.h,
and Movie.cpp/Movie.h

Implementation of the database is found in main.cpp. All media
is stored in a vector, which is a stack-like data structure
not restricted to last-in element access.
